# fancy.py - A Simple Library for Formatted Tag-Based Printing

`fancy.py` allows you to easily print messages with custom tags and color formatting. You can set custom colors for specific tags and print formatted messages with them. If the `rich` library is installed, color formatting will be applied, otherwise, no formatting will be used.

## Requirements

- `rich` (optional but recommended): Used for color formatting.

To install `rich` (if not already installed):
```bash
pip install rich
